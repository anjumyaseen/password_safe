# 📦 Password Safe (v1.0.0)

A simple **local password manager** built with **Python + PyQt5**.
It securely stores your credentials (usernames, emails, URLs, notes) in an encrypted vault file, with search, password generation, and folder organization.

## 🛠️ Installation (Development)

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anjumyaseen/password_safe.git
   cd password_safe
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run app:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## 📦 Build `.exe` (Windows)

Using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/):

```bash
# 1) Generate the .ico (Windows requires ICO for the EXE)
pip install pillow
python tools/make_ico.py    # creates assets\app.ico from icon-safe.png

# 2) Build the EXE

# Option A: CLI (quick test build)
# (Include paths + hidden imports so local modules resolve.)
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ^
  --name PasswordSafe ^
  --icon=assets/app.ico ^
  --paths . ^
  --hidden-import storage ^
  --hidden-import settings ^
  --hidden-import main_window ^
  --hidden-import login_dialog ^
  --hidden-import dashboard ^
  --add-data "icon-safe.png;." ^
  main.py

# Option B: spec file (recommended, reproducible)
pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm .\PasswordSafe.spec
```

- Desktop/taskbar icon (at runtime UI) still uses `icon-safe.png`.
- The pinned/EXE icon comes from the embedded `assets\app.ico`.

* Output binary: `dist\PasswordSafe.exe`
* Ship this `.exe` to end users.
* (Optional) wrap into an installer with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Encryption: Entries are encrypted at rest using AES-GCM with a key derived from your master password (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256).
- Migration: If a legacy plaintext vault is detected, it is encrypted automatically after the first successful unlock.
- Export: The Export to JSON feature writes unencrypted data for portability. Treat exported files as sensitive and remove them when no longer needed.
  - Recommended: Use "Export Encrypted…" (default) for sharing or backup. A passphrase is required and an encrypted `.vaultenc` file is created.
  - Plaintext export is located under File → Export → Advanced and requires typing `YES`. Optionally auto-deletes after 10 minutes (best effort).

---

## ✅ Verify Downloads

Until code-signing is available, verify your binaries after download.

- Windows PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  Get-FileHash .\dist\PasswordSafe.exe -Algorithm SHA256
  ```

- macOS/Linux:

  ```bash
  shasum -a 256 dist/PasswordSafe.exe   # or: sha256sum dist/PasswordSafe.exe
  ```

Compare the output to the SHA256 published on the GitHub Release page.
Optionally, check the VirusTotal scan link provided in the release notes.

To help, scripts are included:

- Generate checksums:

  ```powershell
  pwsh tools\make_checksums.ps1 -OutFile SHA256SUMS.txt -Files dist\PasswordSafe.exe
  ```

- Verify a checksum against the file:

  ```powershell
  pwsh tools\verify_sha256.ps1 -Sums SHA256SUMS.txt -File dist\PasswordSafe.exe
  ```

- Upload to VirusTotal (requires API key):

  ```powershell
  $env:VT_API_KEY = "<your_api_key>"
  pwsh tools\virustotal_upload.ps1 -File dist\PasswordSafe.exe
  ```

## ⚙️ Preferences

Open via Edit → Preferences…

- Clipboard auto-clear: Number of seconds before the clipboard is cleared after a Copy (default 30s). A live countdown appears in the main window status bar at the bottom (e.g., “Password copied. Clears in 29s”). The app clears the clipboard only if it still contains the same copied value, so it won’t erase newer clipboard content.
- Require “Show” before copying password: Optional UX guardrail. When enabled, the password must be visible (Show checked) before it can be copied. This reduces accidental copies but can increase shoulder-surfing risk; leave off unless you value the extra step. Default: off.
- Plaintext export auto-delete (seconds): Best-effort timer to delete a plaintext export created via Advanced → Export Plaintext. Works only while the app remains open and is not a secure wipe (no disk overwrite).
- Auto-lock: Option to enable idle auto-lock and choose the timeout (seconds). When locked, use Help → Unlock Current Vault… (or simply perform an action) to re-enter your master password and unlock.
  - Default: 5 minutes (300 s). Change under Edit → Preferences…

---

## ⬆️ Export / ⬇️ Import

- Export Encrypted…: File → Export → Export Encrypted… (recommended). Prompts for a passphrase, produces a `.vaultenc` file using AES-GCM with PBKDF2-SHA256 (200k iterations).
- Import Encrypted…: File → Import Encrypted… Select a `.vaultenc`, enter the passphrase, and the entries are imported with new IDs.
- Export Plaintext (Not Recommended): File → Export → Advanced → Export Plaintext… Requires typing `YES` in a confirmation dialog. Optionally schedule auto-delete (see Preferences). Treat the resulting `.json` as highly sensitive.

---

## 🗂️ Multi-Vault Tabs

- File → New Vault…: choose a filename (e.g., `personal.psf`), set a master password, opens as a new tab.
- File → Open Vault…: pick an existing vault and unlock; opens as a new tab. Duplicate opens activate the existing tab.
- Tabs are closable and rearrangeable (drag to move left/right). Title shows the active vault name.

---

## 🔒 Locking

- Lock Now: File → Lock Now (Ctrl+L) immediately locks the app (for all tabs).
- Auto-lock: enabled by default at 5 minutes (300 s); change or disable in Preferences (in seconds). Any user activity resets the timer.
- Unlock: Help → Unlock Current Vault… prompts for the master password and re-enables the active tab.
